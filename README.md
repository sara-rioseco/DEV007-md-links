## 1. Introduction

[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is an lightweight markup
language that is used with plain text to add formatting elements (headings, 
bulleted lists, URLs) to text without the use of a formal text editor or the 
use of HTML tags. Markdown is used in many platforms that handle plain text, 
such as Slack, forums, blogs, among others, so it's very common to find several 
files using this format in different kinds of repositories. We don't need to 
go that far to find examples of this, for instance, the classic README file, 
such as this very one, uses Markdown and you can verify that by checking the 
file's extension, which is ".md" and stands for Markdown documentation.

Usually these .md files, contains _links_ that are often broken, or no longer 
accessible. This situation diminish the value of the information you are trying 
to share. That's why this project intends to tackle that problem by reading and 
analyzing Markdown files, verifying the links inside of them and creating a 
report with these links' stats.

## 2. Project definition

This module is a library that can be used to retrieve all links, inside all 
markdown files that are present in a specific path (folder or file). Besides 
that, you can check the status of all the links retrieved and see a summary 
with the stats found on the analysis. Node JS was the javascript framework 
chosen to develop this tool. You can use this library as CLI application or 
as an API. 

This library and the CLI use external libraries as dependencies (such as the [path](https://nodejs.org/api/path.html) module, 
the [FS](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html) module, and the HTTP client [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro), 
and were developed with Javascript to be run with NodeJS. [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), [Eslint](https://eslint.org/) and [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) were also 
used for the developing/testing stages.

## 3. User guide

### As a CLI (Command-Line Application)
#### Installation

Open your terminal and run the following command:

    npm i @sara-rioseco/md-links

#### How to use

Once the installation is complete, run the following command in your 
terminal:

    npx @sara-rioseco/md-links <path> [options]

Where path is the route to the file or directory (it can be an absolute 
or relative path), and options are the additional actions you want to perform. 
Options are non mandatory, and the application will still run if only a path 
is provided. Possible options are: --validate, --stats, or both.

#### Expected output
* No options: if no options are entered , the application will show you all 
the links found in that path. If the path is not valid, or no .md file is 
found and error will appear.

      npx @sara-rioseco/md-links <path>
![no-options](https://github.com/sara-rioseco/DEV007-md-links/blob/main/src/img/response-novalidate-nostats.PNG?raw=true)

* Only --validate: if only the --validate option is entered, the application 
will show you all the links found and will check if they are valid through 
an HTTP request. The status code and a message of ok/fail will be added to 
each link. If the path is not valid, or no .md file is 
found and error will appear.

      npx @sara-rioseco/md-links <path> --validate
![only-validate](https://github.com/sara-rioseco/DEV007-md-links/blob/main/src/img/response-validate-nostats.PNG?raw=true)

* Only --stats: if only the --stats option is entered, the application 
will show you all the links found and will add a message with the total links 
found, and how many of them are unique links (the ones that are not repeated). 
If the path is not valid, or no .md file is found and error will appear.

      npx @sara-rioseco/md-links <path> --stats
![only-stats](https://github.com/sara-rioseco/DEV007-md-links/blob/main/src/img/response-novalidate-stats.PNG?raw=true)

* --validate and --stats: if the --validate and --stats options are provided,
  the application will show you all the links found and will check if they are 
valid through an HTTP request. The status code and a message of ok/fail will 
be added to each link. Also, a message will be added at te end saying the 
total amount of links found, how many of them are unique links (the ones that 
are not repeated) and how many are broken. If the path is not valid, or no .md 
file is found and error will appear.

      npx @sara-rioseco/md-links <path> --validate --stats
![validate-and-stats](https://github.com/sara-rioseco/DEV007-md-links/blob/main/src/img/response-validate-stats.PNG?raw=true)

### As an API (Application Programming Interface)
#### Installation
In order to use the library as an API, follow these steps:

1. Fork the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/sara-rioseco/DEV007-md-links).
2. Open your terminal and use the cd command to go to the folder where you want 
to save the project.
3. Run the following command:

       git clone https://github.com/sara-rioseco/DEV007-md-links.git
4. Open the folder you chose on your code editor software.
5. Open the terminal and you can start using the API.

#### How to use
Run the following command in your terminal:

      node cli.js <path> [options]
Where path is the route to the file or directory (it can be an absolute 
or relative path), and options are the additional actions you want to perform. 
Options are non mandatory, and the application will still run if only a path 
is provided. Possible options are: --validate, --stats, or both.

#### Expected output
* No options: if no options are entered , the application will show you all 
the links found in that path. If the path is not valid, or no .md file is 
found and error will appear.

      node cli.js <path>
![no-options](https://github.com/sara-rioseco/DEV007-md-links/blob/main/src/img/response-novalidate-nostats.PNG?raw=true)

* Only --validate: if only the --validate option is entered, the application 
will show you all the links found and will check if they are valid through 
an HTTP request. The status code and a message of ok/fail will be added to 
each link. If the path is not valid, or no .md file is 
found and error will appear.

      node cli.js <path> --validate
![only-validate](https://github.com/sara-rioseco/DEV007-md-links/blob/main/src/img/response-validate-nostats.PNG?raw=true)

* Only --stats: if only the --stats option is entered, the application 
will show you all the links found and will add a message with the total links 
found, and how many of them are unique links (the ones that are not repeated). 
If the path is not valid, or no .md file is found and error will appear.

      node cli.js <path> --stats

## 4. Unit tests

## 5. Planning

For the planning of this project, I used the Trello app and also GitHub 
Projects, Issues, Milestones and Boards. You can find an image of both 
tools below.

![github-projects](https://github.com/sara-rioseco/DEV007-md-links/blob/main/src/img/github-project.PNG?raw=true)

Also during this stage, I designed a flowchart of the main function of 
the project. There were at least 3 different versions of this flowchart, 
you can see the final version below.
